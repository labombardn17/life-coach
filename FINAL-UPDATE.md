## 🔄 Sync Situation:

### Current Setup (GitHub Pages):
✅ **Code syncs** - Edit on desktop, push, works on iPhone
❌ **Data doesn't sync** - Add note on iPhone, desktop doesn't see it

### Why:
- Data stored in browser localStorage
- Each device has separate storage
- No automatic connection between them

### Solution: Firebase (Recommended!)

**What it gives you:**
```
Gym (iPhone):
- Add note: "Workout 9 complete, increased weight"
- Saves to Firebase Cloud
- Syncs in 2 seconds

Home (Desktop):
- Open app
- Note is already there!
- Add IB task
- Syncs to iPhone

EVERYWHERE. ALWAYS. AUTOMATIC. ✨
```

**Cost:** $0/month (free tier covers you)
**Setup:** 1 hour total (5 min you, 45 min me)
**Result:** Two-way real-time sync forever!
