## 💡 PRO TIPS:

### Organize Like a Pro:

Task naming:
✅ "Build 3-statement model"
✅ "Update football field valuation"
✅ "Draft management presentation"

Assignments:
✅ Use real names or roles
✅ "John (Associate)" or "Sarah (Analyst)"
✅ "Me" for your own tasks
```

### Priority System:

High (Red):
- Due soon
- Critical path
- Senior review items

Medium (Orange):
- Important but not urgent
- Regular work
- Support tasks

Low (Green):
- Nice to have
- Future items
- Low priority admin
```

### Status Workflow:
```
To Do → Start working → In Progress
In Progress → Ready for review → Review
Review → Approved → Done

```
